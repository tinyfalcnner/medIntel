# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at:
# [https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning)
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants".
  # See: [https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images](https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images)


  # For details regarding adding assets from dependencies, see:
  # [https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package](https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package)


  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here.
  # Each entry in this list should have:
  #  - a "family" key with the font family name.
  #  - a "fonts" key listing the asset and its descriptors.
  #
